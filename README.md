# Form autocomplete with vanilla JS
Vanilla JavaScript codes to copy values of text fields to other text fields using a check box.
JSDOC is used for the first time to generate documentation for the JS functions.

This project is based on the second peer reviewed assignment of the [Interactivity with JavaScript](https://www.coursera.org/learn/javascript) course given by the University of Michigan at Coursera.

## APIs and libraries
- HTML5, CSS, JS
